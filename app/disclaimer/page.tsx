              content you access or process through the service.

              You also agree not to use the service in a way that infringes
              trademarks, passes off your activity as endorsed by a third party,
              removes attribution or proprietary notices when such removal is
              prohibited, or misleads others about the ownership or origin of

              Any use of the word &quot;Twitch&quot; on this site or in the
              product name is intended only to describe the subject matter of
              the service, namely that users may submit or inspect content
              originating from the Twitch platform. The name is used in a
              descriptive, referential sense only, not as a claim of brand
              ownership, partnership, official status, or endorsement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where applicable under relevant law, that referential use is
              intended as nominative fair use: only so much of the mark is used
              as is reasonably necessary to identify the third-party platform,
              and not to suggest that this service is operated, licensed, or
              approved by that platform owner.
            </p>
            <p>
              This site does not use Twitch&apos;s logos, brand styling, or
              trade dress as source identifiers for the service itself. To the
              extent third-party marks appear in user-requested results,
              previews, titles, channel names, or metadata, they remain the
              property of their respective owners and appear only as incidental
              references tied to user-requested content.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nothing on this site grants any user a license to use third-party
              trademarks, media, branding, or other protected material outside
              whatever rights that user already has under applicable law.
